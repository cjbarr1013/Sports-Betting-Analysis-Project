# Sports Betting Analysis Project

This program uses Python and data from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/), [API-NBA](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/API-NBA), and [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/injuries) to analyze NBA player props, and Excel/VBA to display the results in an easy to digest format.
